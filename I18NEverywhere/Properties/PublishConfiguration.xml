# I18n EveryWhere

## If your save/game broken...

Take a deep breath and check out this message from StarQ(at Discord):

If your save isn't loading (aka the game is crashing after pressing Load Game), you need to use Skyve's Safe Mode to investigate the issue. Safe Mode will allow the game to not crash but you can't play on this mode regularly. It is highly recommended to keep the game paused, you can enable "Start Paused" from Gameplay options. It is also recommended to use Very Low graphics settings for troubleshooting. If you get a error popup shows which errors about `ElectricityFlowEdge` or (if you don't get the error popup) you look at the `Player.log` and see errors about `ElectricityFlowEdge`, then your save is corrupted. But fear not it is recoverable. I dubbed this event as a plague. It seems like the issue is being caused by the Anarchy recent version. It is now recommended to downgrade Anarchy to version 1.6.4 until it is updated. If you want to recover your save after the downgrade, you'll need to load into the save in safe mode and then find the broken segment. It can be roads, tracks or cables. There is no obvious sign to find it, so the best method is to start deleting roads, save, reload and check if the error persists. When you get no error (popup may not appear, so absolutely check the bottom of `Player.log`), that means you've deleted the broken segment in between your last save. Alternatively, I can help you recovering your save if all this feels too much; create a thread in the channel with the name "Broken Save - YOURNAME", share your save and ping me.

Provides convenient localization features to reduce the burden on authors and provide centralized coverage.

Keeps authors from being overwhelmed by

- Self-implemented language file loading
- Handling different text encodings

## Usage:

1. Create a new "lang" folder in the mod folder.
2. Add localization json, like en-US.json, zh-HANS.json.

### Example (`zh-HANS.json`)

{

    "Options.SECTION[I18nEveryWhere.I18nEveryWhere.Mod]": "国际化",

    "Options.TAB[I18nEveryWhere.I18nEveryWhere.Mod.General]": "通用",

    "Options.OPTION[I18nEveryWhere.I18nEveryWhere.Mod.Setting.Overwrite]": "重写",

    "Options.OPTION_DESCRIPTION[I18nEveryWhere.I18nEveryWhere.Mod.Setting.Overwrite]": "使用模组内置的语言覆盖原本的语言"

}
